# React Portfolio

## Application

Using create-react-app to develop a one-page website.

## User Story

It's very important for participants of this class to have porfolios to show they are ready to work.  Learning how to do it clean and easily understandable is a very important skill to have.

## Bugs

I started to run out of time to do this, so I had to use a template to finish, but I learned a bunch by using the template and modeling mine after it.  I'm going to schedule a tutor session to figure this out, but the only way it can be run is by doing the npm start at the moment.  For some reason it's not letting the link work.  I'll be digging into that.
